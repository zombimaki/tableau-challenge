### Phenomena and Findings

#### 1. Millenials are the most active users of the CitiBike Service and usage tends to decline as the generations get older or younger from this group.

Even though Millenials are the most active users overall, individuals born in 1969 where the gender is unknown are the most active users greatly surpassing all other gernerations and age groups. However, people could be selecting this age as a joke due to the sexual innuendo. This year is clear outlier and should be considered with skepticism. 

Usage in the CitiBike service fell dramatically in April 2020 when compared to previous years most liekly due to COVID-19. Usage by month was down from previous years except for in the month of October where it just slightly overtook 2019. For Gen X overall usage was down but they did have an increase in usage during the summer months and October. For gen Z usage was up every month except for April in 2020 when compared to the previous years except for April this could be due to this generation entering the workforce. The rest of the generations all had less usage when compared to previous years.

#### 2. St Grove PATH is the most active starting point and destiation regardless of gender. However when looking accross generations this location is only the most active for Baby Boomers, Generation X, and Millenials. In 2020 the activity was only 51% of what it had been in 2019 and 62% of what it had in 2018. This is could due to COVID-19 causing people to not travel as much however it is worth noting that other stations saw an increase during the same period such as Newport Pkwy and Liberty Light Rail which saw upticks in activity when compared to previous years. Generation Z which is the youngest generation in the set saw an increase in Grove St PATH activity in 2020 but they had a much greater uptick in acitivty with Sip Ave and Liberty Light Rail than previous years and both of those stations were more active than St Grove PATH in 2020. Located in downtown Jersey City, New Jersey, this is a popualar station close to shopping and entertainment.

#### 3. The Subscriber user types tend to use the Citibike service more than the Customer service type for the Baby Boomers, Generation X and Millenial generations with the usage becoming greater with each younger generation regardless of gender. Generation Z saw similar usage between customers and subscribers until 2020 when there was more usage among customers than subscribers. Users that have identified as male tend to use the service more than users who are identified as female or unknown.
